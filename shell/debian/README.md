# Shell setup for debian-ubuntu/zsh/zoxide shell

A reproducible dev environment


Trying to setup this dev container using multiple/combined approaches:

- devcontainer.json - metadata and setup scripts for dev containers
- Dockerfile - more advanced config using dockerfile commands
- install.sh - similar to dockerfile, shell style install commands
- .zshrc - shell specific config and plugins





## PROGRESS

[x] container initializes

[x] Dockerfile installs packages and deps

[ ] run devcontainer.postStartCommand (source .zshrc)
    command is being invoked but not successfully sourcing the file?
    has to be run manually...
